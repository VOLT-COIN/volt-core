### Option 2: The "Listing & Partnership" Pitch (Professional) 🤝
**Subject: Listing Proposal: Volt (VLT) - A Next-Gen Rust Layer 1**

**Project Overview:**
Volt (VLT) is a sovereign Layer 1 blockchain engineered in Rust to address the scalability and safety limitations of legacy C++ chains. By leveraging the memory-safe guarantees of Rust and the egalitarian RandomX consensus mechanism, Volt offers a secure, decentralized, and accessible network for value transfer and future decentralized applications.

**Key Metrics:**
- **Ticker:** VLT
- **Consensus:** Proof-of-Work (RandomX)
- **Supply:** 21,000,000 (Deflationary Halving Model)
- **Status:** Mainnet Live (v1.0.22)

**Technical Differentiation:**
Unlike the majority of new projects which are tokens on existing chains, Volt is a vertically integrated solution with its own P2P network, consensus engine, and state machine, designed for high throughput and atomic asset swaps.
