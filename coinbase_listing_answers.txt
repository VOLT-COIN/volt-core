Here are the suggested answers for the Coinbase Asset Listing Form:

---

**1. Project / Asset Name:**
Volt

**2. Asset Symbol / Ticker:**
VLT

**3. Project Description (Summary):**
Volt is a high-performance Layer 1 Proof-of-Work blockchain built entirely in Rust. It eliminates the memory safety vulnerabilities of C++ legacy chains while delivering fast block times (60 seconds) and a secure decentralized network. Volt supports native asset issuance and is developing a specialized smart contract layer (VoltVM).

**4. Website URL:**
https://volt-core.vercel.app

**5. Whitepaper URL:**
(Use the GitHub README or BitcoinTalk for now as we don't have a PDF)
https://github.com/eslamsheref5000/volt-core/blob/main/README.md

**6. GitHub Repository:**
https://github.com/eslamsheref5000/volt-core

**7. Asset Type:**
Native Layer 1 Blockchain (Coin)

**8. Consensus Mechanism:**
Proof of Work (PoW)

**9. Hashing Algorithm:**
SHA-256d (Double SHA-256)

**10. Max Supply:**
21,000,000 VLT

**11. Circulating Supply:**
(Approx) 50 VLT (Genesis Era)

**12. Smart Contract Address:**
N/A (This is a Layer 1 Blockchain, not an ERC-20 token)

**13. Date of Launch / Genesis:**
January 1, 2026 (or Current Date)

**14. Contact Email:**
(Enter your own email address)

**15. Listing Justification:**
Volt represents the next evolution of PoW chains, rewriting the standard Bitcoin implementation in safety-critical Rust. It is fair-launched with no ICO and community-driven.

**16. Link to CoinMarketCap / CoinGecko:**
N/A - New Launch (Day 1). We are in the process of submitting verification requests.

**17. Project and Token Utility:**
*   **Live Utility:** VLT is the native currency used for network consensus (Mining Rewards) and transaction fee payments. It enables peer-to-peer value transfer without intermediaries.
*   **Roadmap Utility:** VLT will be used to deploy smart contracts (VoltVM) and pay for Asset Issuance fees (Tokenization Layer) starting Q2 2026.

**18. US Market Availability:**
Yes. Volt is a decentralized Layer 1 blockchain offering equal access globally. It is designed as a utility commodity (digital resource) similar to Bitcoin, with no ICO or centralized issuer.

**19. Executives:**
(Since this is a decentralized open-source project, you should state that.)
*   **Name:** N/A (Decentralized Community Project)
*   **Role:** Founder / Lead Developer (Pseudonymous or utilize your real name if preferred)
*   **Links:** https://github.com/eslamsheref5000

**20. Address of Incorporation:**
N/A - Volt is a decentralized software protocol, not a corporation. It has no physical headquarters or legal entity.

**21. Entity Issuing Assets:**
None. The assets (VLT) are issued programmatically by the blockchain protocol through Proof-of-Work mining (Coinbase transactions). There is no central issuer or pre-mine.
